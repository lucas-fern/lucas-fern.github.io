Hi! I’m Thiago Marzagão and I do data analysis for academic, policy-making, and hedonistic purposes. I just got my PhD at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2412325). Now I’m working for the Brazilian antitrust agency ([CADE](http://cade.gov.br/)), where I help automate cartel detection. I’ve created this site to share some useful [resources](http://thiagomarzagao.com/resources/) I’ve found along the way, as well as some content of my own – stuff like my [papers](http://thiagomarzagao.com/papers/), my [robotics project](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py), [bits](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2015/01/20/classifying-goods-and-services/) of my current work, and my [webscraping tutorial](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2013/11/12/webscraping-with-selenium-part-1/). Also, here’s my [résumé](https://thiagomarzagao.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/resume_thiagomarzagc3a3o.pdf).

You can reach me at marzagao dot 1 at osu dot edu.
