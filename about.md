Hi! I’m Thiago Marzagão and I do data analysis for academic, policy-making, and hedonistic purposes. I got my Ph.D. at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06161) (I was funded by the [Fulbright Commission](https://fulbright.org.br/) and by the Brazilian government), and now I work for the [Observatory of Public Spending](http://www.cgu.gov.br/assuntos/informacoes-estrategicas/observatorio-da-despesa-publica) (a division of the Comptroller General of Brazil), where I use machine learning to fight corruption.

I have worked for the Brazilian antitrust agency ([CADE](http://cade.gov.br/)), where I built CÉREBRO - an app that detects bid-rigging in public procurement. I have also taught [statistics](/teaching/EADM) and [data mining](/teaching/EPA109738) (at [IDP](http://www.idp.edu.br/administracao/) and [UnB](http://adm.unb.br/) respectively) and plan to do so again at some uncertain point in the future. You can find more details about my work in my [papers](http://thiagomarzagao.com/papers/), [talks](http://thiagomarzagao.com/talks%20&%20slides/), [code](http://thiagomarzagao.com/code/), and [résumé](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thiagomarzagao/resume_ThiagoMarzagao.pdf).

I also play with LEGO robots (I've made a [Python module](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py) that makes it easy to program LEGO Mindstorms EV3 bricks), write tutorials ("[webscraping with Selenium](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2013/11/12/webscraping-with-selenium-part-1/)" is by far the most popular one), [discuss Brazilian music](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2015/12/24/text-analyzing-brazilian-music/), listen to podcasts (check [The History of English Podcast](http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/) and [Talk Python to Me](https://talkpython.fm/)), read sci-fi (mostly Neal Stephenson and John Scalzi these days; here's my [Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45921922-thiago-marzag-o)), binge-watch assorted series, and waste time on social media.
