Hi! I’m Thiago Marzagão and I do data analysis for academic, policy-making, and hedonistic purposes. I got my PhD at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2412325). Now I’m working for the Brazilian antitrust agency ([CADE](http://cade.gov.br/)), where I help automate cartel detection. I’ve created this site to share some useful [resources](http://thiagomarzagao.com/resources/) I’ve found along the way, as well as some content of my own – stuff like my [papers](http://thiagomarzagao.com/papers/), my [robotics project](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py), [bits](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2015/12/14/classifying-government-expenditures/) of my current work, and my [webscraping tutorial](http://thiagomarzagao.com/resources#selenium). Here’s my [résumé](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thiagomarzagao/resume_ThiagoMarzagao.pdf).

You can reach me at marzagao dot 1 at osu dot edu. Also, I'm on Twitter ([@tmarzagao](https://twitter.com/tmarzagao)) and [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/45921922-thiago-marzag-o?shelf=read&sort=date_read). (I'm on [LinkedIN](https://br.linkedin.com/in/thiago-marzag%C3%A3o-101084b0) too but I never check it.)

Thanks for visiting!
