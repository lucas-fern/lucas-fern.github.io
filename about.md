Hi! I’m Thiago Marzagão and I do data analysis for academic, policy-making, and hedonistic purposes. I got my PhD at the Ohio State University, where I mined news articles to create a [machine-coded democracy index](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2412325) (I was funded by the Fulbright Commission and by CAPES). Now I’m working for the [Comptroller General of Brazil](http://www.cgu.gov.br/), where I help automate corruption detection. (Before that I worked for the Brazilian antitrust agency - [CADE](http://cade.gov.br/) -, where I helped automate cartel detection.) I also teach [statistics](/teaching/EADM) and [data mining](/teaching/EPA109738) (at [IDP](http://www.idp.edu.br/administracao/) and [UnB](http://adm.unb.br/) respectively). I’ve created this site to share some useful [resources](http://thiagomarzagao.com/resources/) I’ve found along the way, as well as some content of my own – stuff like my [papers](http://thiagomarzagao.com/papers/), my [robotics project](https://github.com/thiagomarzagao/ev3py), [bits](http://thiagomarzagao.com/2015/12/14/classifying-government-expenditures/) of my current work, and my [webscraping tutorial](http://thiagomarzagao.com/resources#selenium). Here’s my [résumé](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thiagomarzagao/resume_ThiagoMarzagao.pdf).
