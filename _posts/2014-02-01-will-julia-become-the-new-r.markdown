[Julia](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/) is turning two this month. It's supposed to be as fast as C and as easy as Python. Here's what people have been saying about it:

[38-page Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7109982) of Julia's pros and cons, comparisons to Python, R, Matlab/Octave, etc.

["Julia breaks down [...] the wall between your high-level code and native assembly."](http://www.evanmiller.org/why-im-betting-on-julia.html)

["The Julia code takes around 8 milliseconds to complete, whereas the R code takes around 4000 milliseconds."](http://www.johnmyleswhite.com/notebook/2012/03/31/julia-i-love-you/)

[Julia has powerful abstractions and good performance](http://assoc.tumblr.com/post/71454527084/cool-things-you-can-do-in-julia)

If you are curious you can [try Julia online](http://forio.com/julia/repl/) before you install it.
