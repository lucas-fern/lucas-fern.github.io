title: The Role of a Technical Business Analyst
hidden: true
---

This post - targeted towards undergraduate students exploring potential careers - will investigate the role of a Technical Business Analyst, hereafter referred to as a Business Analyst or BA. The different sections of the post will draw on advice from a Business Analyst in a small Melbourne-based software company to explore the personal and professional qualities required for a productive and rewarding career in such a role. The responsibilities of a BA in a typical workplace will be summarised, and opportunities for career development from such a position are also investigated.

# Roles and Responsibilities
A business analyst is responsible for connecting and coordinating the interaction between technical teams in an organisation, and the commercial vision of the business; for this reason a BA is said to assume a techno-commercial role. For this report I interviewed the Senior Technical Business Analyst at Melbourne based company Lucidity Software. I will first discuss his experience in his current and previous roles, then assess how typical the responsibilities he is assigned are for employees in similar positions at other organisations.

An excerpt of Lucidity's organisational structure is shown in Figure 1, and the individuals which the BA (outlined in yellow) interacts with closely are connected with blue dotted lines. He describes his primary role within the company as taking the functional priorities as defined by the Chief Product Officer and translating them into technical requirements, which can be actioned upon by the technology lead and development team. This requires a deep familiarity with the technology and tools used by the development team, as well as the more strategic vision of the business and their product.

When translating business priorities to technical specifications, Lucidity's BA considers three fundamental questions which are highly indicative of his role in the process; Why?, What?, and How?. To elaborate, it is his role to consider; why will implementing this generate tangible benefits for the business and its stakeholders? What solution can realistically be implemented to generate this positive value? And how will this solution be implemented on a technical level with the tools and skills available to our development team? These critical decisions are the core of the role, and carefully considering each of them is critical to developing specifications for updates to Lucidity's products which generate positive value for the business.

In addition to creating these technical specifications, Lucidity's BA plays a critical role in their implementation of the Agile methodology. Agile is an approach to managing projects which focuses on delivering software products in small iterations by dividing large projects into small pieces which can be completed by an individual over a two week period, called a sprint. \[1\]

As defined by the methodology the development team is referred to as the 'Scrum Team', and the Business Analyst assumes the role of the 'Scrum Master', who coordinates the two week sprints. A sprint begins with the technical specifications which have been prepared by the BA; and the team (in collaboration with the Scrum Master) divides these into consumable tasks which are completed during the sprint. During the sprint, the Scrum Master is somewhat involved in the software testing process, then at the end of each two week period the Scrum Team assess the results of the sprint in a discussion with the Business Analyst and the stakeholders, and make any required adjustments to ensure success in the following sprint.

The role of Lucidity's Business Analyst is highly typical of people in the same role at companies of a similar size, however in larger companies these responsibilities may be broken up and completed by a group of people. In this case the business analyst would usually be responsible for the process of converting business objectives to technical specifications and assessing the potential for each project to deliver positive value to the company. The role of coordinating the development team would then be assigned to an individual who could dedicate more resources into their organisation and management. The more technical responsibilities, such as involvement in testing are also less common in larger organisations. \[2\]

Since the Business Analyst in a large organisation has a reduced responsibility for the technical aspects, they are able to dedicate more time to the evaluation of business processes and the implementation of efficient practices to continuously improve the pace at which they deliver their product or service. This is assisted by the additional data available to them in the larger organisational environment. Importantly, although the Agile Scrum methodology is extremely common in the world of software, many other methodologies exist for the the successful management of development teams.

# Requirements for Success
A successful career as a business analyst requires a range of skills of a technical, professional, and personal nature. This section will discuss some of these skills drawing on the experience of Lucidity's Business Analyst in his current and previous roles, as well as additional independent research.

## Technical Skills
The BA position necessitates a deep understanding of the technology and software tools used within a business so that functional requirements can be translated to specifications which can be realistically implemented by a development team. A few of the most essential skills for the position follow.

### The Agile Methodology
As mentioned above, the Agile Methodology is a way of managing a development team for efficient production of effective software. According to the 15th State of Agile report, conducted in 2021 \[3\] a massive 94% of software companies surveyed globally implement one of the many forms of the Agile methodology. It is therefore extremely important that anyone interested in pursuing a Business Analyst role is aware of some of the ways to implement an Agile approach. The most popular methodologies are the Scrum, ScrumBan, and Kanban, which account for 81% of all software development teams \[3\], so it is almost essential to be familiar with these.

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
Another important part of the BA role is the ability to determine whether projects will be profitable for the business to implement. This requires an ability to assess the financial costs that implementation will incur, and evaluate whether the venture will be profitable after considering the revenue which it is expected to generate. \[2\] \[4\]
As well as considering the financial aspect of such a decision it is important to be able to consider the human element of how various employees and stakeholders will be impacted by such a decision, and consider the risk and probability of failure which each decision entails.

### Company Specific Technology
In addition to the technical skills which are relevant to the position in general, different companies will require knowledge of vastly different technologies. Lucidity - for example - delivers a web based application, therefore knowledge of web development and programming languages like JavaScript is highly relevant. Other companies which deliver alternative technologies will of course require different specialised skills, and someone looking to break into the field should seek a company which can make use of their specific technical knowledge.

## Personal and Soft Skills
All kinds of personal skills are required for an outstanding BA, and it's hard to think of such a skill which wouldn't add value to a candidate's application. Here we will discuss just two which are critically important for success.

### Oral and Written Communication \[2\]
The ability to communicate effectively is at the core of the role of a BA. This skill was chosen as one of the most important since the skilled BA has to be able to communicate effectively with both technical and commercial departments of the business, and translate requirements and results between the two. It can be especially challenging to translate technical requirements back into something that can be interpreted by other departments of the organisation, and therefore excellent communication skills are a must.

### Problem Solving
The ability to solve problems by breaking them down into manageable chunks is also essential to the BA role, especially as the software development landscape becomes dominated by the Agile methodology. This is because the methodology requires that problems be broken down into small chunks which can be worked on in parallel. This skill is also imperative when performing analysis of the costs and benefits of a proposal.

# Opportunities for Development
Working in a techno-commercial role, the Business Analyst has the unique opportunity of being able to progress into highly technical roles, such as into development, though this is more likely to be where they transitioned into the BA role from. Alternative technical roles could include a lateral shift to management of development teams, or relocation to increasingly larger organisations. Other options include upskilling to an enterprise architect, or ultimately a Chief Technology Officer.

On the other hand, the commercial and managerial skills of the BA allow them to make the transition into pure management roles. In a smaller organisation this might mean transitioning upward to become the Chief Product Officer, interacting directly with stakeholders to form functional requirements, or in large organisations to the intermediate role of a business architect, who fulfils a very similar role between the technical and commercial teams, but with more of a focus on developing the high level business strategy.
