title: hurry up if you are webscraping LexisNexis Academic
---

LexisNexis Academic [will have a new interface](http://wiki.lexisnexis.com/academic/index.php?title=Academic_Interface_Refresh) on December 23rd. So if you're webscraping them your code will probably stop working and you'll need to rewrite it completely. Better hurry.
