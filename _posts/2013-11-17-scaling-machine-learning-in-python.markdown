title: scaling machine learning in Python
---

I just came across this PyData talk on Python tools for parallelizing machine learning applications. It's worth watching if you have tons of texts and doing things sequentially is just not working for you.

You can find other PyData talks [here](http://vimeo.com/pydata). (The ones from the last PyData NYC, held last weekend, are already there.)
