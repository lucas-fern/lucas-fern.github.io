title: 'aRrgh: a newcomer''s (angry) guide to data types in R'
---

[Here](https://github.com/tdsmith/aRrgh).

First paragraph:

> R is a shockingly dreadful language for an exceptionally useful data analysis environment. The more you learn about the R language, the worse it will feel. The development environment suffers from literally decades of accretion of stupid hacks from a community containing, to a first-order approximation, zero software engineers. R makes me want to kick things almost every time I use it.
